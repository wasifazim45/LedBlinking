+ # Getting Started With LED
+  * Here we can simulate our embedded system projects or electronic circuits with microcontrollers or new electronic circuit simulator.
+  * That new electronic circuit simulator is known as SimulIde.
+  * SimulIde is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator which is open source.
+  * SimulIde is not so much professional but it is very easy to use.
+  * it have enough features for students to learn and do projects with microcontroller like PIC, AVR and Arduino boards.
+  # Projects overview




+  * In our Project, here we created a circuit using a atmega328 microcontroller.
+  * so i have connected 8 LED on the port B of the microcontroller atmega328.
+  * On each pin there is 1 led from bit 0 to bit 7 of the microcontrollers.
+  * Each led is connected with a paticular port B of the microcontroller.
