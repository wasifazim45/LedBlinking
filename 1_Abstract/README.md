+ # Getting Started With LED
+  * Here we can simulate our embedded system projects or electronic circuits with microcontrollers or new electronic circuit simulator.
+  * That new electronic circuit simulator is known as SimulIde.
+  * SimulIde is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator which is open source.
+  * SimulIde is not so much professional but it is very easy to use.
+  * it have enough features for students to learn and do projects with microcontroller like PIC, AVR and Arduino boards.
+  # Projects overview




+  * In our Project, here we created a circuit using a atmega328 microcontroller.
+  * so i have connected 8 LED on the port B of the microcontroller atmega328.
+  * On each pin there is 1 led from bit 0 to bit 7 of the microcontrollers.
+  * Each led is connected with a paticular port B of the microcontroller.
+  * On the port D of the microcontroller, we have connected a relay. so on the pin D1 of the port D, there is a relay.
+  * And on the relay, a buzzer is connected to the terminal of the relay and the other terminal of the relay is connected to a voltage source of 5 volts that is fixed.
+  * Here relay will switch on the buzzer.
+  * Before need the simulation mode, we have to burn the HEX file of a programe on to the microcontroller.
+  * So before burning the HEX File , we have a develop a program for the microcintroller atmega328 to compile it.
+  * so we have made a program for this circuit which will send the values from 0 to 250 on the port D and also made the port D high to turn on the relay.
+  * when the relay will switch on the buzzer then buzzer will make a sound.
+  * After run in the simulation mode, we can see that led is getting blinking.
+  * Here we have send the values on the port D 0 to 250. so according to that led are turning on and off.
+  * Here we can also observes some buzzers sound also.
